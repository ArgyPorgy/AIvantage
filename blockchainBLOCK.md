Explanation of the components:

- `index`: A unique identifier for the block in the blockchain. It helps maintain the chronological order of the blocks.
- `timestamp`: The date and time when the block was created. It ensures the blocks are sequenced in a time-ordered manner.
- `data`: The actual content of the block, which can be a transaction, message, or any relevant information in the form of an object.
- `from`: The sender of the transaction (e.g., "UserA").
- `to`: The recipient of the transaction (e.g., "UserB").
- `amount`: The amount involved in the transaction (e.g., 10).
- `device`: Information about the device used for the transaction, represented as an object (e.g., { no: "Device001" }).
- `verification`: The status of the transaction verification (e.g., "Pending" or "Confirmed").
- `idoftransaction`: A unique identifier for the transaction (e.g., "12345abc").
- `connection`: The type of network connection used for the transaction (e.g., "WiFi" or "4G").
- `previousHash`: The hash of the previous block in the blockchain. It ensures the integrity and immutability of the blockchain.
- `hash`: The hash of the current block. It represents the unique fingerprint of the block's content and ensures its integrity.
- `nonce`: A random number used in mining the block. It is adjusted during the mining process to find a hash that satisfies the difficulty criteria.

Each block in the blockchain is linked to the previous block through the `previousHash`, forming a chain of blocks, which is the fundamental concept behind blockchain technology.
